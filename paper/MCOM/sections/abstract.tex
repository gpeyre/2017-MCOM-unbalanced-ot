	This article introduces a new class of fast algorithms to approximate variational problems involving unbalanced optimal transport.
	%
	While classical optimal transport considers only normalized probability distributions, it is important for many applications to be able to compute some sort of relaxed transportation between arbitrary positive measures.
	%
	A generic class of such ``unbalanced'' optimal transport problems has been recently proposed by several authors.
	%
	In this paper, we show how to extend the, now classical, entropic regularization scheme to these unbalanced problems. 
	%
	This gives rise to fast, highly parallelizable algorithms that operate by performing only diagonal scaling (i.e.\ pointwise multiplications) of the transportation couplings. They are generalizations of the celebrated Sinkhorn algorithm. 
	% 
	We show how these methods can be used to solve unbalanced transport, unbalanced gradient flows, and to compute unbalanced barycenters. We showcase applications to 2-D shape modification, color transfer, and growth models.
